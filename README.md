# Androms

<h3 align="center">
Hello! This repo is counting all the Android 
roms I have found so far.
</h3>

## What's allowed and what's not
This list is meant to store semi-modern devices, basically the newer the better.

There isn't any particular cutoff date for when a device is considered modern or
"older", so multiple factors should be considered. I have created a scoring
system to get a general idea of how old your device is, and if it's eligible to 
be on this list.

Is the device more than 7 years old? If yes, add 1 point to your score.

Does the device support 4/5G? If no, Add 3 points to your score

Is the device stable in the custom rom? If no, Add 5 points to your score.

Does the device have <4GB ram? If yes, Add 2 points to your score.

Does the device have <64GB storage? If yes, Add 1 point to your score.

Does the device have <1.5GHz CPU? If yes, Add 2 Points to your score.

If you got more than or equal to 3 points, but less than 5 points, then double
check with me before adding.

If you got more than or equal to 5 points, then it's a no.

Any less than 3 and you're good! ðŸ˜Ž

## Why??
Privacy! Big tech spies on everyone nowadays, so I thought I would make this list
to help people. Of course, using a custom rom wont make you anonymous, so you'll
have to take other measures as well.

## Thanks
Thank you for checking out my repo!!!
I'm not too good at this, so please feel free to suggest any improvements.
