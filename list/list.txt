Hello! This is a list of the (major and STABLE!!!) roms for
some smartphones.

I'm not going to put super-duper old phones on here,
as this list is meant for day-to-day use.

The same goes for custom roms, if they're unmaintained, buggy,
or unstable in general, I won't put them on here.

This list includes multiple devices, so if you have one that's
compatible

Feel free to suggest any devices to be added, just please
abide by the rules above.
